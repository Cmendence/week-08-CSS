        Nothing quite compares to playing a video game for the first time and
        getting that feeling of awe as you are immersed in a new world. With
        technology advancing faster than ever and thousands of new games being
        released every year, it's easy to overlook the games that changed us.
        Whether it's awesome gameplay, cool new mechanics, beautiful landscapes,
        a gripping story, or a combination of these, gamers often wear their
        favorite games as a badge of honor. With that being said... <br />

        <b>Portal</b><br />
        I awoke in the Aperture Science Computer-Aided Enrichment Center for the
        first time... and immediately threw both the radio and the coffee cup
        into the toilet. <br />
        Initially released as part of the Orange Box, most thought Portal was a
        trial. In reality, it was a phenomena; a physics game masterpiece that
        changed the world of puzzle games.<br/> You play as Chell, a test subject at
        Aperture Science. Led by GLaDOS (Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating
        System), you take part in a series of tests - physics-bending
        puzzles - using the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device. After Chell
        finishes the final test and is offered her reward(cake), we quickly
        learn GLaDOS has other plans... <br /><br />
        But remember! The cake is a lie! ...Or is it?

        /><br />
        <b>Portal 2</b><br />
        Just when you think perfect can't get any more perfecterer... They made
        a Portal 2! This game picks up after the events of the first game, and
        re-raises the bar of what puzzle games could be. The story of Chell,
        Cave Johnson, and Caroline is very easy to miss, but is so deep that you
        will keep finding yourself wondering for weeks afterward what could have
        been, or, what actually was...? <br /><br />
        Also, they added co-op! After the events of Portal 2, GLaDOS has now
        created two new reusable robots for testing. No longer is she burdened
        with having to find humans to test her experiments! You play as ATLAS
        and P-body in a whole new set of test chambers built for two people,
        requiring two portal guns for twice the fun!

        /><br />
        <b>The Witness</b><br />
        In The Witness, you awake in a dark chamber. After opening the door, you
        find yourself on a beautiful but deserted island. You do not know how
        you arrived here, but as you explore, you keep finding maze-type puzzle
        panels. Using the tools provided, you progress through the game and
        learn the many panel mechanics, and slowly unlock pieces of the mystery
        surrounding this magical place.

        <b>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</b><br />
        Sorry, Link! But our Princess is in anoth.. Oh, she <i>is</i> in the
        castle? And she's trapped! From the moment you step out of your
        suspended animation chamber and see the vast Kingdom of Hyrule, you'll
        be hooked. Fighting, cooking, flying, and saving the day! What more
        could you ask for? The characters are lively. The story is engaging and
        funny. I want to go there. But wait! What's that over there?? You can
        easily sink 50+ hours into this game and not finish the main story.<br />
        Fun for all play styles, BotW is the perfect blend of puzzle game and
        open world RPG.

        /><br />
        <b>Halo: Reach</b><br />
        Halo: Reach is the only first-person shooter that ever made any sense to
        me. You play as Master Chief, a towering supersoldier known as a
        "Spartan", raised and trained from childhood for combat.<br />
        Released in 2010, Halo was already a popular and established franchise.
        I got into Halo: Reach because some friends were into it (spoiler- we
        were all terrible). 13 years later, it is <i>still</i> my go-to game
        when I need to unwind and shoot some bad guys. It differs from Call of
        Duty type FPS games in that the Spartan soldiers run faster, jump
        higher, and have armor as well as health. Also, with Halo: Reach, the
        game introduced new abilities(called Loadouts) that enable the player to
        do things like create a decoy hologram, use a jet pack, and create an
        impenetrable shield for a short time.
