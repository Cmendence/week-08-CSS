        Nothing quite compares to playing a video game for the first time and
        getting that feeling of awe as you are immersed in a new world. With
        technology advancing faster than ever and thousands of new games being
        released every year, it's easy to overlook the games that changed us.
        Whether it's awesome gameplay, cool new mechanics, beautiful landscapes,
        a gripping story, or a combination of these, gamers often wear their
        favorite games as a badge of honor. With that being said...

            <h2>1. Portal</h2>
            <p>
              I awoke in the Aperture Science Computer-Aided Enrichment Center
              for the first time... and immediately threw both the radio and the
              coffee cup into the toilet. Initially released as part of the
              Orange Box, most thought Portal was a trial. In reality, it was a
              phenomena; a physics game masterpiece that changed the world of
              puzzle games. You play as Chell, a test subject at Aperture
              Science. Led by GLaDOS (Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating
              System), you take part in a series of tests - physics-bending
              puzzles - using the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device. After
              Chell finishes the final test and is offered her reward(cake), we
              quickly learn GLaDOS has other plans...
              <br /><br />
              But remember! The cake is a lie! ...Or is it?

            <h2>2. Portal 2</h2>
            <p>
              Just when you think perfect can't get any more perfecterer... They
              made a Portal 2! This game picks up after the events of the first
              game, and re-raises the bar of what puzzle games could be. The
              story of Chell, Cave Johnson, and Caroline is very easy to miss,
              but is so deep that you will keep finding yourself wondering for
              weeks afterward what could have been, or, what actually was...?
              <br /><br />
              Also, they added co-op! After the events of Portal 2, GLaDOS has
              now created two new reusable robots for testing. No longer is she
              burdened with having to find humans to test her experiments! You
              play as ATLAS and P-body in a whole new set of test chambers built
              for two people, requiring two portal guns for twice the fun!

              In The Witness, you awake in a dark chamber. After opening the
              door, you find yourself on a beautiful but deserted island. You do
              not know how you arrived here, but as you explore, you keep
              finding maze-type puzzle panels. Using the tools provided, you
              progress through the game and learn the many panel mechanics, and
              slowly unlock pieces of the mystery surrounding this magical
              place.

              Sorry, Link! But our Princess is in anoth.. Oh, she <i>is</i> in
              the castle? And she's trapped! From the moment you step out of
              your suspended animation chamber and see the vast Kingdom of
              Hyrule, you'll be hooked. Fighting, cooking, flying, and saving
              the day! What more could you ask for? The characters are lively.
              The story is engaging and funny. I want to go there... But wait!
              What's that over there?? You can easily sink 50+ hours into this
              game and not finish the main story.<br />
              Fun for all play styles, BotW is the perfect blend of puzzle game
              and open world RPG.

            <h2>5. Halo: Reach</h2>
            <p>
              Halo: Reach is the only first-person shooter that ever made any
              sense to me. You play as Master Chief, a towering supersoldier
              known as a "Spartan", raised and trained from childhood for
              combat.<br />
              Released in 2010, Halo was already a popular and established
              franchise. I got into Halo: Reach because some friends were into
              it (spoiler- we were all terrible). 13 years later, it is
              <i>still</i> my go-to game when I need to unwind and shoot some
              bad guys. It differs from Call of Duty type FPS games in that the
              Spartan soldiers run faster, jump higher, and have armor as well
              as health. Also, with Halo: Reach, the game introduced new
              abilities(called Loadouts) that enable the player to do things
              like create a decoy hologram, use a jet pack, and create an
              impenetrable shield for a short time.
